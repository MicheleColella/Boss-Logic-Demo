# Boss-Logic-Demo

The Boss Code is a Unity test module designed to simulate complex boss behavior, suitable for integration with various projects, requiring minimal setup. This project aims to create a modular boss system adaptable to all environments. Instead of a static boss that merely chases the player and performs a single attack, this system utilizes a behavior tree to dictate how the boss reacts to its surroundings.

## Key Features
- **Attack**: The boss can perform various attack moves.
- **Retreat**: The boss can move backwards to maintain distance from the player.
- **Walk Forward**: The boss can advance towards the player.
- **Circle Around the Player**: The boss can move in a circular pattern around the player.
- **Idle**: The boss can stay in a stationary position.
- **Run**: The boss can move quickly towards or away from the player.
- **Custom Attack**: The boss can execute a unique attack move.

## Compatibility
The project is optimized for compatibility with Unity 3D, ensuring it fits seamlessly into any Unity environment and codebase.

## Ease of Use
Designed with user-friendliness in mind, the system emphasizes ease of use and configuration, enabling developers to integrate and customize the boss behavior in just a few steps.
